          I am Antonio! I went from <span>painter</span> üé® to{' '}
          <span>developer</span> üë©‚Äçüíª, deciding to change the canvas for the
          screen. Although I miss the feel of a canvas, I'm moved to create
          something new and exciting with every line of code I write.

          I designed my first website when I was 16 years old. I didn't have
          access to the necessary information to make the project go beyond a
          static website that I could only see locally but that unsatisfied
          curiosity has been the seed of my interest in knowing the complete
          process of web design and what would end up moving me to study a full
          stack bootcamp a few years later.

          It has been a risky bet in personal, family and economic terms,
          leaving my comfort zone in a drastic way but I couldn't feel more
          satisfied with the results and knowing not only how to design a full
          stack web, but also how to do it supported by testing and clean,
          readable code.

          From now on I know many <span>challenges</span> and
          <span>great people</span> are waiting for me on the way.
